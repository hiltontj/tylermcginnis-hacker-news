# tylermcginnis-hacker-news
This is my tylermcginnis.com hacker news clone React application. It is the final project for Tyler McGinnis's React course which you can find [here](https://tylermcginnis.com/courses/).

## React Hooks!

_NOTE: I am refactoring this application to use React Hooks over the vanilla ES6 class components. `git checkout hooks` to see these changes._

## Setup

You will need to have `npm` installed. Once you clone this repo to your local system, hop in, and do
```
npm install
npm run start
```
This will run the `webpack-dev-server` and allow you to view the application at `localhost:8080`.
